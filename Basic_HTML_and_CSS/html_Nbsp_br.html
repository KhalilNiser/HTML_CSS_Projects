            <p>When the Creator fashioned the human body, the<br>
            human soul refused to enter because it didn’t<br>
            want to take on the body’s limitations. The<br>
            Creator then began to play music. In order to<br>
            feel the fullness of this music through the <br>
            senses and receptivity of the human form, the<br>
            soul was coaxed into the body. — Russill Paul<br>
            relaying an ancient Sufi story in <u>The Yoga
            of Sound.</u>
