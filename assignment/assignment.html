<h1>The Tech Academy Topics and Courses:</h1>

<p id="paragrach">The_Tech_Academy cover hundreds of the most in-demand<br>
Computer Languages and courses in Technology:</p>

<h2 id="heading">Java</h2>
<blockquote cite = "https://www.oracle.com/java/">
Oracle Java is the #1 programming language and development platform.<br> 
It reduces costs, shortens development timeframes, drives innovation,<br> 
and improves application services. With millions of developers running<br> 
more than 60 billion Java Virtual Machines worldwide, Java continues<br>
to be the development platform of choice for enterprises and developers.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="heading">JavaScript</h2>
<blockquote cite = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled)<br>
programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-<br>
known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environ-<br>
ments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.<br>
JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic<br>
language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="heading">GIT</h2>
<blockquote cite = "https://gitforwindows.org/">
Git for Windows focuses on offering a lightweight, native set of tools<br> 
that bring the full feature set of the Git SCM to Windows while<br>
providing appropriate user interfaces for experienced Git users and<br> 
novices alike.
<h4 id="heading">GIT BASH</h4>
Git for Windows provides a BASH emulation used to run Git from the<br>
command line. *NIX users should feel right at home, as the BASH<br>
emulation behaves just like the "git" command in LINUX and UNIX<br>
environments.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="heading">C#</h2>
<h4 id="heading">WHY C#</h4>
<blockquote cite = "https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp">
C# is a modern, innovative, open-source, cross-platform<br> 
object-oriented programming language and one of the top 5<br>
programming languages on GitHub.<br>
Do you have experience with JavaScript, Java, or C++? You'll<br>
find C# instantly familiar, and you'll enjoy its evolving<br> 
features including type safety, generics, pattern matching,<br> 
async, records, and more.
